# teach.me
Our final project - in this description I would like to outline our set of standards at some point.

Priorities
1) Take a look at githooks - Should allow for strong testing 
2) ruby cop -> nforces ruby style guide. 

Standards 

1. Test complex logic -> It was agreed amoung the seniors at Bitmaker that we only really have to worry about testing our complex apps -> remember how much employers love well tested code! 

2. comments -> If it is not apparant what the code is trying to accomplish right away we should:  
           1) Refactor
                or 
           2) Commenting the code



                                Helpful things 

Git Workflow

    git init /// creates new git repository
    git add . /// adds files to staging
    git add --all ///adds files to staging (incl deleted) 
    git commit -m "<message>" /// moves files to repo
    git status /// checks the status of files
    git log /// shows history of commits
    git fetch //Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches.
    git commit --amend -m // amend a commit when you do not feel the notes are accurate. 

BRANCHING 

    git branch -a /// shows all branches
    git branch <branch_name> /// creates <branch_name>
    git checkout <branch_name> /// switches to <branch_name>
    git merge <branch_name> /// brings new branch back to current branch
